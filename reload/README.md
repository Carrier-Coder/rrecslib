#### Reload Tables

The tables, as presented in the comprehensive guide:
1. Do not seem to be based off of the numbers from the 4241-M
2. Do not contain enough entries

The program in table gen will extrapolate out the table for more entries.
It uses the same numbers from the table (see the excel file in the folder)
even though they are suspect.
